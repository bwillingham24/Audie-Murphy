        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>Audie Leon Murphy (20 June 1925 – 28 May 1971)was an American soldier, actor, and songwriter. He was widely celebrated as the most decorated American combat soldier of World War II, and has been described as the most highly decorated soldier in U.S. history.</p>
        
        <p>Murphy was born into a large family of sharecroppers in Hunt County, Texas. After his father abandoned them, his mother died when he was a teenager. Murphy left school in fifth grade to pick cotton and find other work to help support his family; his skill with a hunting rifle helped feed his family.</p>

        <p>After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Murphy's older sister helped him to falsify documentation about his birthdate in order to meet the minimum age requirement for enlisting in the military. Turned down initially for being underweight by the Army, Navy, and the Marine Corps, he eventually was able to enlist in the Army.</p>

        <p>SGT Audie Murphy lived a fulling life as a war hero, a famous movie star, and a songwriter. Unfortunately, his life was cut short in 1971 when his plane crashed into the side of a mountain 14 nautical miles (16 mi; 26 km) northwest of Roanoke, Virginia, in conditions of rain, clouds, fog, and zero visibility.
